# Our website allows the user to input in a search bar the food that they are looking for. Then, this information is sent to the backend, where a dictionary with hundred(s) of restaurants and their menus are searched. If the "boujee" checkbox is not ticked, the application will find the cheapest (up to three) options of food in all the menus of the restaurants. Then, the restaurant names, menu item, and price will be displayed. If "boujee" is selected, the app works this same way, this time displaying the most expensive items.
